                    <p>We collaboratively plan a collecting strategy and maintain a continuing dialogue as our clients’ collections and experiences with art grow. For new collectors our initial focus is on developing a critical eye for the most enjoyable and enriching collecting experience. With established collectors, we make them aware of new opportunities and continue to build the collection based on their interests. Our goal is for a deliberate, confident collecting strategy in which clients appreciate both the artist’s work and are comfortable with the market.</p>

                    <p>After years of researching and viewing artwork, we have indepth knowledge of successful artwork at every price point. Whether we find work at artist’s studios, private dealers, galleries or international auction houses, we are able to connect clients with with art they love.</p>

                    <p>With roots in high-end art advisory and galleries, we bring world-class advisory services to all client projects -- large and small. From accompanying clients on their first studio visit to installing a work in a home, we handle each appointment and detail with precision.</p>

                    <p>At the heart of our firm is the belief that supporting artists and living with art is both an important and enriching experience.</p>
